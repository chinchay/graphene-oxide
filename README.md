## Potentials
- **mtp_2D_GO**: Potential for graphene oxide as a 2-dimensional material (GO)
- **mtp_3l_GO**: Potential for a graphene oxide nanoribbon of 3lines (3-AGONR)
- **mtp_2D_GO_14to16A**: For GO, with training constrained to [14.5 $\overset{\circ}{\mathbb{A}}$, 16.5 $\overset{\circ}{\mathbb{A}}$].
- **mtp_3l_GO_14to16A**: For 3-AGONR, constrained to [14.5 $\overset{\circ}{\mathbb{A}}$, 16.5 $\overset{\circ}{\mathbb{A}}$].
- **DFTrelaxations**: Quantum Espresso was used to `relax` different structures that can be compared to ML
- **mtp_nAGNR**
- **O defects**
- **B and N substitutions**
