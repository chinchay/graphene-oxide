# MTP for graphene oxide nanostructures

This repository stores data from trainings for graphene oxide (GO), as a 2D and as ribbons, for paper `Machine learning for shape memory graphene nanoribbons`

## Potentials
- mtp_2D-GO: Potential for GO as a 2-dimensional material
- mtp_3-AGONR: Potential for 3lines GO nanoribbon
- mtp_2D-GO-14to16A: Constrained to the interval 14Angstrom to 16.5Angstrom, for 2D GO
- mtp-3-AGORN:  Constrained to the interval 14Angstrom to 16.5Angstrom, for GO nanoribbon of 3 lines
