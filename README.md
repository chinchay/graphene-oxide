# MTP for graphene oxide nanostructures

This repository stores data from trainings for graphene oxide (GO), as a 2D and as ribbons, for paper `Machine learning for shape memory graphene nanoribbons`

## Potentials
- **mtp_2D_GO**: Potential for GO as a 2-dimensional material
- **mtp_3l_GO**: Potential for 3lines GO nanoribbon
- **mtp_2D_GO_14to16A**: Constrained to the interval 14Angstrom to 16.5Angstrom, for 2D GO
- **mtp_3l_GO_14to16A**:  Constrained to the interval 14Angstrom to 16.5Angstrom, for GO nanoribbon of 3 lines
- **DFTrelaxations**: Quantum Espresso was used to `relax` different structures that can be compared to ML
