## Potentials
- **DFTrelaxations**: DFT relaxations of 2D structures and nanoribbons, used for machine learning trainings
- **mtp_2D_GO**: Potential for graphene oxide as a 2-dimensional material (GO)
- **mtp_2D_7l**: Potential generated using GO and graphene oxide nanoribbons of 7lines (7-AGONRs). Contains calculations for larger nanoribbons using only machine learning
